'''
- **Training Data**: Use a validation dataset for initially training the base DNN and the learned caches.
- **Batching and Sampling**: For online adaptation, maintain a sample window of input queries to retrain the caches periodically.

4. Training the Base Model

- **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable DNN architecture (e.g., ResNet-50) and train it on your dataset using standard training procedures in PyTorch.

5. Designing Learned Caches

#### a. Predictor Network
- **Architecture**: Simple neural network models, such as fully connected (FC), pooling-based, or convolutional layers.
- **Training**: For each hidden layer output of the base DNN, train a predictor network to mimic the final output of the DNN using the collected hidden layer outputs and their corresponding final predictions.

#### b. Selector Network
- **Architecture**: A simpler network that performs binary classification to decide if the predictor network’s output can be considered a cache hit.
- **Training**: Train the selector network using the predictions from the predictor network and ground truth labels to minimize false positives.

6. Initial Deployment and Composition

- **Exploration Phase**: Explore multiple learned cache variants for each layer of the base DNN, computing their hit rates, accuracy, lookup latency, and memory cost.
- **Composition Phase**: Formulate and solve an optimization problem to select a set of learned caches that minimize average latency while meeting accuracy, memory, and computational constraints.

7. Integrating into an Inference Workflow

- **Query Planner**: Develop a query planner that splits the latency budget among different nodes of the DNN and selects the most accurate DNN model that can be executed within the allocated budget.
- **Incremental Replanning**: Implement a mechanism to replan the remaining nodes of the DNN based on cache hits, dynamically adjusting the latency budget to improve accuracy without violating the overall latency SLO.

8. Online Adaptation

- **Cache Adaptation Service**: Periodically retrain the learned caches using recent input samples to exploit temporal locality in the workload.
- **Retraining Parameters**: Determine suitable retraining intervals and sample sizes to maintain high cache hit rates.

9. Implementation Details

- **Concurrency**: Use asynchronous computation for cache lookups to avoid inflating tail latencies.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the system using a scalable architecture, possibly involving containerized microservices for each component.

10. Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**: Measure the latency, accuracy, and memory usage of the re-implemented model.
- **Comparison**: Compare against baselines such as quantization, model pruning, and distillation to validate the effectiveness of learned caches.
### Code Example (Simplified)

Here’s a basic outline of the code structure in Python using PyTorch:

This code is a simplified version. The actual implementation will involve more details, such as handling different layers, integrating the learned caches, and setting up the query planner and incremental replanning.

By following these steps, you can re-implement a model similar to the one described in the paper, leveraging learned caches to reduce inference latency while maintaining high accuracy.'''
